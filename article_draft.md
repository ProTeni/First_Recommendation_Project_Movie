hey
so, i was distraught on what project to work on o how to start. All i know is I wanted to work on aproject that enahnced customer experience (asoert of always piqued my interest a great deal).

I alos wanted a poject that dcould predict or be usable by everyone or anyone not juts big companies- tnetativly.

I was in between an ecommnerce project to enhance recommend produscts to ecommerce ( a siliar project to what i had done on a gropup project at CodeOP tech school but i felt i didnt popul in my weight as much but this time i thought to work a real data by web scarpiing and pushing topm production- but if id dpus to projcution- nopt everyone can use outsiede the scfope of the ecommerce polatform they're buyiong the product from.) I watched some Youtube videos i9nitially to gather some ideas ion what I can work on. MORE IMPORTANTLY, i WANTED THE PROJECT TO EMCOMOPASS DATA ENGINEERING TO ML-OPs.

A big challenge but bet its as exciting to jump on!

To begin with, I sorted out my folders- even if I dint know everything that'd be going into it yet- I did that. My resprt is ot learn everyskill required and know the project like the back of my hands. And then based of the learnt webscarpping and ML-OPs work onj other Machine Learning projects (there are tons of them anyways) Let's go!
